<h2>This is an <br>emergency.</h2>
<p>Life on Earth is in crisis. Our climate is changing faster than scientists predicted and the stakes are high. Biodiversity loss. Crop failure. Social and ecological collapse. Mass extinction.</p>
<p>We're running out of time, and our governments have failed to act. Extinction Rebellion was formed to fix this.</p>
<p><strong>We have a moral duty to take action - whatever our politics.</strong></p>

<h4>This stuff is real.</h4>
<h2>The science is clear. Our future is not.</h2>
<p>We are on the brink of a global catastrophe. Life on Earth is in danger, with scientists agreeing we are entering a period of climate and ecological breakdown. From wildfires to heatwaves, droughts to rising sea levels, the symptoms of our inaction will only worsen, then longer we take to address the causes of this crisis.</p>

<h4>What you can do.</h4>
<h2>The time to act is now.</h2>
<p>Traditional strategies like petitioning, lobbying, voting and protest have not worked due to the rooted interests of political and economic forces. Our approach is therefore one of non-violent, disruptive civil disobedience â€“ a rebellion to bring about change, since all other means have failed.</p>
