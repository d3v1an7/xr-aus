## This is an <br>emergency.

Life on Earth is in crisis. Our climate is changing faster than scientists predicted and the stakes are high. Biodiversity loss. Crop failure. Social and ecological collapse. Mass extinction.

We're running out of time, and our governments have failed to act. Extinction Rebellion was formed to fix this.

**We have a moral duty to take action - whatever our politics.**
