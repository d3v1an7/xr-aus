##### September XX

## A national declaration of civil disobedience.

{% columnGroup %}

{% column -%}

**Life on earth is in trouble.**

Whole species are going extinct. People all over the world are suffering and dying. This isn’t a distant apocalypse. It will only get worse.

Governments are doing nothing. Businesses are doing nothing.

{%- endcolumn %}

{% column -%}

**Who is going to save us?**

It’s up to you. You can’t count on someone else to do this for you. Not us. Not Greta. It’s time to look inside yourself and take action.

## We must rebel.

{% div "max-w-2xl" %}

Starting on September XX, Extinction Rebellion is calling an International Rebellion. Together, we will [peacefully](https://rebellion.earth/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Extinction-Rebellion-Rebel-Agreement.pdf) occupy the centres of power and shut them down. We will demand that governments Tell the Truth about our Climate and Ecological Emergency. We will demand that they Act Now.

Leave your desk. Invite your boss. Walk out of school. Switch off the TV. Put down your phone.
